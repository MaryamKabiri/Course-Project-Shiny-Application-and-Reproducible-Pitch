Introduction
============= 
- Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is one of the ambient air pollutant which are really harmful to human health.
- Since 1990's, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has developed and enforced regulations for PM2.5 and tracked the emissions of the pollutant into the air. 
- The database for emissions of PM2.5 is known as the National Emissions Inventory (NEI), and it is released by EPA every three years.
- I use data for 1999, 2202, 2005, and 2008 to find out if the PM2.5 emissions has decreased in the United Staes.

Conclusion
==========

- The total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the United Staes from 1999 to 2008.
- The total emissions from PM2.5 in Los Angeles decreased from 1999 to 2005 and then increased in 2008. In Baltimore, it decreased, then increased, and finally decreased again in 2008.
- Overall there is a downward ternd in PM2.5 emissions in both cities from 1999 to 2008.
